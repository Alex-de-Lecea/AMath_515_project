This repository contains the code to train and evaluate a deep autoencoder on (1) MNIST data and (2) fluids data of flow past a cylinder exhibiting vortex shedding. Example training notebooks can be found for each corresponding dataset. More involved grid searches and line searches are also included in notebooks. AdditionalMaterial contains unpolished code also used for this work.

For a ready-to-run example run MNIST_Example.ipynb. It will download all data and train an autoencoder.

For cylinder examples, the data can be acquired by contacting the owner of the repository.
